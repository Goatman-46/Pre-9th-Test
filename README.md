  <h1>Solve 2  Long questions out of the following 3 questions :</h1>
  <p>I.The decibal scale measures sound intensity using the formula L=40 Log(I/Io). If a sound has intensity (I) of 10^6 times the reference intensity (Io). What is the sound level in decibels.</p>
  <p>II.Abdullah invested Rs.100,000 in a saving scheme and gains interest at the rate of 5% per annum so that the total value of this investment after t years is Rs y. This modelled by an equation y = 100,000(1.05)^t, t os greater than or equal to 0. Find after how many years the investment will be double.</p>
  <p>III.In the year 2016, the population of a city was 22 million and was growing at the rate of 2.5% per year. The function p(t)=22(1.025)^t gives the population in millions, t years after 2016. Use the model to determine in which year the population will reach 35 million. Round the answer to the nearest year.</p>
